#Web Scraping and Data Processing#


*Overview* 
This Python script is designed for web scraping and data processing. It allows you to scrape content from a list of URLs, extract specific elements from the HTML structure, and save the processed data.

*Prerequisites*
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
Requests library (pip install requests)
BeautifulSoup4 library (pip install beautifulsoup4)
Pandas library (pip install pandas)

*Usage*
Replace the link list with the URLs you want to scrape.
Run the script using Python:
Copy code
python web_scraping.py
The script will visit each URL, scrape relevant content, and process it as described in the code.

*How It Works*
The script iterates through the list of URLs and fetches the HTML content of each page using the requests library.
It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and locate specific elements within the page, such as headings, paragraphs, list items, and tables.
Content is processed and organized based on the HTML structure and certain conditions defined in the code.
Processed data, including the title and content, is saved in a dictionary format and stored in the header list.

*Output*
The script saves the scraped and processed data in the header list, which can be further saved as json file . The content is also saved to a file named etmoney.json.

*Error Handling*
The script includes basic error handling to handle exceptions that may occur during web scraping. In case of an error, it will print an error message and continue processing the next URL.
